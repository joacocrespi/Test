Aliens: A Short Story

Ava stared out of her window where the storm was shaking the trees and rain fell down in bucketfuls. She sighed, there would be no going out today. Not that there was much to go out for, everything she needed was indoors. Her books, her old laptop, tea and biscuits. A person didn’t need much else to live on. Ava went back to typing her up her story. Her phone began to ring and she picked it up. It was aunt Mabel. “Hello?” said Ava. “Hey, I was just ringing to let you know that May’s staying for dinner, if that’s alright, she doesn’t want to come home in the rain,” said Mabel. “Yes, no that’s fine it is pouring outside,” Ava agreed. “Yes, it is. Alright, thanks, we’ll send her back this evening.” “Yep, no worries,” Ava said and hung up. As soon as she did, her phone started to ring again. “What now?!” Ava asked out loud. When she saw who it was, her demeanour quickly changed. “Hey Jasp, what’s up?” she said cheerfully. “I’ve decided to do it,” her boyfriend replied quickly as if he couldn’t hold it back. “Oh,” said Ava. The line went quiet for a while as she digested the news. She knew what he was talking about of course but she didn’t know how she was supposed to react. “Well, good for you,” she said finally. “Thanks.” “When-” “I’m there now,” he interrupted. “Ok. Do you want me to stay on the line with you?” Ava asked. “No, it’s alright. I’ll come round tomorrow after it’s done?” “Sure,” Ava agreed. “Ok, bye.” “Bye,” Ava whispered as Jasper hung up.

She tried to turn her attention back to the story at hand but she couldn’t focus. She shut the laptop in anguish and turned on the TV instead. As the intro to ‘Ghosts’ played Ava again looked out of her window at the rain raging war outside. It felt like it perfectly reflected the torrent of her emotions.

Ding dong went the doorbell as Ava rushed downstairs calling out “I’ll get it!” At the bottom of the stairs she paused, mentally trying to prepare herself. “Hey,” said Ava as she opened the door for Jasper. He stepped inside and, for all Ava’s mental preparation, she still couldn’t stop the shock she felt. His black curls were now a silvery white and his kind brown eyes had been replaced with colourless irises. Ava felt her heart stop beating as she tried desperately to process her dramatically changed boyfriend. The silence between them felt so thick Ava thought she was drowning in it. Jasper stood avoiding her gaze as he waited for her to say something. “You’re an alien,” was all she could muster. He nodded, his newly white eyes still trained on the floor. Ava swallowed the hard lump that was rising in her throat and gestured for him to go upstairs. They went into Ava’s room and she shut the door behind them. Jasper finally tore his eyes up from the carpet and looked into hers. She tried not to look away. He grinned. “So how terrible do I look?” he asked. Ava laughed but it was hollow. “You look great Jasp, you truly do,” her smile was sincere but so were the tears in her eyes. “Thanks lovely,” he replied and moved forward to hug her but she dodged his hands and faced away from him out of the window. He would not see her tears fall down her face like a river. “Hey look I know it’s different, I know it’s strange but I’m still me,” he pleaded. She turned sharply towards him, her sadness rising into fury. “Oh, are you really? How can you still be yourself when you’re literally an alien!” she asked him angrily. He didn’t deny the fact. “Even your voice doesn’t sound like you,” she muttered. They paused again, neither speaking, neither moving. After a while Ava relented and pulled Jasper’s arms around her. “You know, I’m still happy with my choice, “ she said into his shoulder. “I know.” “It’s just hard being the only human seventeen year old,” she told him. “I know.” They paused again. Ava leaning into his weight to his heartbeat. At least that hadn’t changed. “So when do the powers kick in?” she asked, lighting her head to face him. “A fortnight from now,” he answered. “Did you know that they’re making most jobs only eligible for alien ID carriers?” she mused. “Then you must become an alien,” he laughed. “Or forge an ID card,” she giggled and felt her heart lift just a little.

“Hey Ava!” sang out Pearl as she caught up with her by the vegetable stall. “Hi Pearl,” Ava replied, not looking up the tomatoes she was putting into a little brown paper bag. “Guess what?” “What?” asked Ava, finally looking up from the vegetables. Pearl had the same silver hair and white eyes that Jasper now sported but Ava was used to seeing her like it. “I met a girl our age the other day her name’s Esme-” “And?” asked Ava, impatient. “She’s human!” Ava stared at her, not quite believing it was true. “Really?” there was a hopeful tint to Ava’s voice. Pearl nodded enthusiastically. “I spoke to her, she’s really nice, she wants to be an artist and she lives in Roseville, just outside the city. I got her number too if you want to call her.” Ava gave a small nod of her head, her whole being alight with happiness and excitement.

The front was painted green with small orange roses climbing up either side. Ava stepped up and tapped the knocker twice. The door was opened by a petite girl who’s blonde hair was like golden hay and eyes a sea of green. Ava smiled. “Hi, you’re Esme, right?”
